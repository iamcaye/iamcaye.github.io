I've been away for a while, for college and work reasons,
but now i'm back and i'm going to try to be more persistent on this.
I've been learning a lot of new things and i want to share them with you.

My goal is to write at least one post per week,
but i'm not going to be very strict about it. I'm going to write about
the things that i'm learning, some projects that i'm working on
and some opinions that i have about the tech world.

I also want to continue making cheatsheets and maybe some tutorials,
i think that it's a good way to learn and to help others.
It helps me clarify the concepts and it's a good way to review
the things that i've learned.

Right now i'm into Kubernetes, doing a course from UDEMY,
working at TOPdigital as a software engineer and doing some personal projects.
I will write about these things in the next posts.
