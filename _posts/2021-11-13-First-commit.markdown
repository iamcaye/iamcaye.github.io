<h1>First commit, so original...</h1>

This is going to be a blog which i'll use to talk about the new things that i'm learning or some theme i find interesting. I'm not going to be very persistent on this and really don't know if i'll be using it weekly or monthly.

As far as i've been using this tool, it's very efficient and intuitive, in a couple of minutes you can have a static website fully working. I still have to find out how to tweak the layouts and if it's not very time consumming maybe i create a minimal theme, but the default one is very simple and kind of what i was looking for.

*I'll be talking about Jekyll in this post but right now it's all i have to say about it*
